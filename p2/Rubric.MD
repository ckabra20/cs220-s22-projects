# Project 2 (P2) grading rubric

## Code reviews

- A TA / grader will be reviewing your code after the deadline.
- They will make deductions based on Rubric provided below.
- To ensure that you don't lose any points in code review, you must review the rubric and make sure that you have followed the instructions provided in the project correctly.

## Rubric

### General guidelines:
- Do not hardcode output to any question (-4 deduction per instance of hardcoding)
	- For example, if the question asks for the output of 2 + 3, don’t just type and output 5, output the expression 2 + 3. You must show your working (expression) for that question according to what is asked.
	- For example, if the question asks for the type of 2 + 3, don’t just output int, output the expression type(2 + 3)
- Do not change any lines which have been marked as “DO NOT CHANGE” by a comment. (-4 deduction per instance)

### Question specific guidelines:
- Q14, Q15: Proper comparison operator must be used, as per the English to Python expression translation. Look at the translations provided below Q15, for verifying your answers.
	- There was an error in q14 that asked to solve for distance instead of time. don't mind if the var name is distance. Contact Saurabh if they actually solved for distance - that wouldn't have passed test.py.
- Q17, Q18: Do not create any new variables. (-3)
- Q17, Q18: Changes you make must match the corresponding English sentences. (-3)
- Q20: Do not change any line other than line which is tagged as "#ONLY CHANGE THIS LINE". (-3)
